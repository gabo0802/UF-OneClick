# Sprint 1

## User Stories
* As a site member, I want a login page so I can access the website.
* As a site member, I want to be able to add and remove subscriptions as needed so that I can keep my current subscriptions accurate.
* As a site member, I want a way to track the cost of each subscription I have so that I can see which subscriptions I spend the most on in a year.
* As a site member, I want a profile page so that I can update or view my information.

## Initial Plans

## Accomplishments

Back-End:
* Created a remote database and established a connection to it by using the mysql package.
* Added the ability to set up tables to store main user data, all subscriptions available, and subscriptions linked to users.
* Can reset tables, add usernames and passwords, add new subscription names, and link subs to users with a date and time that tracks when it is added or removed.
* Login checks if the username and password exist on the "Users" table before accessing the account.
* Beginner functionality in connecting to the frontend where data can be stored in the database through the "Sign Up" page on the website.

## What didn't work
Front-End:
* Ran out of time to implement other features.
* Ran out of time to implement profile page because we were learning the basics of angular and go.
* As for implementing the profile page we need to learn more about user authentication.
